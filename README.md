# arcade.ly

[arcade.ly](https://arcade.ly) is a site for modern homages to classic arcade games. These homages are built with modern web technologies and, on the client side, use only HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS with no need for additional plug-ins, such as Flash. As such they work in a wide variety of desktop browsers and devices.

This repository exists to house code samples that arcade.ly makes available to illustrate various principles it uses to build its games.

Currently available games:

- **[Star Citadel](http://starcas.tl)** - a homage to the 1980 Cinematronics game, Star Castle

We have a number of upcoming games planned or in development, including homages of classics such as Space Invaders, Asteroids, and Missile Command.

If you have any feedback or requests, please add them to https://github.com/bartread/arcade.ly/issues.

Enjoy!
