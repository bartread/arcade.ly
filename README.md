# arcade.ly

[arcade.ly](https://arcade.ly) is a site for modern homages to classic arcade games. These homages are built with modern web technologies and, on the client side, use only HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS with no need for additional plug-ins, such as Flash. As such they work in a wide variety of desktop browsers and devices.

This repository exists to house code samples that arcade.ly makes available to illustrate various principles it uses to build its games.

Currently available games:

- Star Citadel - a homage to the 1980 Cinematronics game, Star Castle - available at [starcas.tl](http://starcas.tl)

We recommend use of the domain hacks because the site is likely to undergo some structural reorganisation as more games are added and this will reduce the number of unnecessary redirects in the future.

We have a number of upcoming games planned or in development, including homages of classics such as Space Invaders, Asteroids, and Missile Command.

If you have any feedback or requests, please add them to https://github.com/bartread/arcade.ly/issues.

Enjoy!
